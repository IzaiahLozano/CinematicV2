1. Non-interactive cinematic with beginning/middle/end: For the non-interactive media, this was shown in the production logo/name scene. It starts 
off by the letters of the production name flying in and getting into position, while this is happening there should be audio playing in the 
background. After the letters get in position the word "production" starts to fade in through the middle of the scene. After everything has loaded 
in it ends with a fade out to black. 

2. Interactive cinematic feels alive when untouched: To make the scene feel alive when untouched I applied that to the main menu scene. When 
untouched there is still little stars that give off a twinkling affect. I was able to accomplish this goal with the help of ChatGpt to make a 
randmoizer. 

3. Interactive cinematic feels alive touched: For the interactive feel when touched this is also seen in the main menu scene, when the player hovers over any of the three options, play, controls, and credits. When it's hovered over the button scales up.

4. Choreography in code: For the main menu scene I opted to use the timeline techinique because I needed different events happening at specified times but it ws easier to run them through the timline sequence.
